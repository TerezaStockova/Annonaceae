Hello sweet souls!

You are welcome here by, in practice, a science student; at heart, a mathematics nerd. Yep, that's me (accompanied by some VS Code Pets). 
During my bachelor's studies at Maastricht University, I discovered the art of biological computation, taxonomical organisation, and sports analysis. 
My free time is dedicated to honours research at the Maastricht Centre for Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, and to sports bouldering at Radium Boulders. 
Currently, I mainly work on the biological part of the research. In 2026, however, you can expect exciting things to come during my thesis analysing boulder routes, so make sure to check out my GitHub!

Take care and good luck with your endeavours :)
